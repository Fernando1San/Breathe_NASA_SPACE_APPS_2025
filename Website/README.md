## Overview

Breathe is a responsive landing + product page for an air-quality project. The home page opens with a fixed, translucent navbar (HOME/ABOUT/SERVICE/DESIGN/CONTACT) over a full-screen hero image. The hero pairs a left-aligned heading—“Air Quality”—and a short message about why clean air matters with a frosted, translucent image card on the right. A smooth gradient divider leads into a dark “About the project” section that explains the solution in plain terms.

The project has two parts:

Mobile app: ingests NASA satellite data and, with optional user details (age, health conditions, activity goals), sends personalized notifications (e.g., good day to exercise, caution for sensitive groups).

Offline device: a sensor unit (name TBD) that reads local air quality where there’s no signal or Wi-Fi, shows status on the device, and can share data locally (e.g., Bluetooth).

Further sections (e.g., Introduction to the app, descriptive blocks and images) are laid out to wrap or stack cleanly on tablets and phones. A footer offers CTAs like Download App, Buy, and GitHub.

The separate Buy page presents a clear “Time to buy!” headline with a product image on the right and an orange “Sold out” badge beneath it (desktop two-column; centered stacking on tablet/mobile). A fixed orange navbar includes a Back link (arrow + text) that changes color on hover as a single unit.

Design highlights: dark background with #ff7200 accents, justified copy for readability, frosted-glass cards, smooth anchor scrolling with offset for the fixed navbar, and careful media queries so everything stays aligned and legible on mobile and tablet.

# Breathe_NASA_SPACE_APPS_2025
2025 Hackathon for NASA all code and information
## Overview
Breathe is a mobile and IoT application developed in MIT App Inventor that enables real-time monitoring and prediction of air quality, integrating information from:

Satellite data provided by NASA’s TEMPO mission.

Low-cost local sensors integrated into the Breathe Node device (ESP32U, MQ-131, MQ-4, PMS5003).

The system collects data from the sensors and APIs, analyzes them through a Python-based server, and sends the results back to the mobile app via a REST API using JSON format.
The mobile application displays the Air Quality Index (AQI), identifies dominant pollutants, and provides personalized health recommendations based on the user’s profile (age, weight, medical condition, physical activity level, etc.).
The goal of Breathe is to protect public health, raise environmental awareness, and promote citizen participation in air quality measurement—combining satellite science and sensor technology in a collaborative ecosystem.

# Breathe_NASA_SPACE_APPS_2025
2025 Hackathon for NASA all code and information
## Overview
Breathe is a mobile and IoT application developed in MIT App Inventor that enables real time monitoring and prediction of air quality, integrating information from Sentinel-5P TROPOMI satellite mission and low-cost environmental sensors.
The system collects, analyzes, and visualizes air pollution data to provide users with personalized health recommendations based on their environment and personal profile.
In addition to its mobile and IoT components, Breathe also includes an AI powered chatbot linked to ChatGPT, which allows users to interact naturally with the system,  asking questions about air quality, understanding pollutant levels, and receiving guidance on how to stay safe in varying atmospheric conditions.
Furthermore, the project features a dedicated web platform that shares educational resources, real-time updates, and information about the project’s technologies and environmental impact. This website aims to raise public awareness and promote community participation in air-quality monitoring.
The goal of Breathe is to protect public health, raise environmental awareness, and promote citizen participation in air quality measurement—combining satellite science, sensor technology, and artificial intelligence in a collaborative ecosystem.

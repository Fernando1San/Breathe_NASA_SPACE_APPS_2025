# Hardware 
## Description
To complement the main mobile application—which displays real-time air quality information from an online server—this hardware prototype was developed to directly measure environmental data and provide more accurate and localized readings for the system.

The prototype consists of a custom-designed PCB built around the ESP32-WROOM-32UE microcontroller.
This module integrates Wi-Fi connectivity, enabling the board to transmit sensor data to the central server where it can be processed and displayed by the app.

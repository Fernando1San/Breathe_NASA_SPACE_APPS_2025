## Overview
This project contains one production firmware for the real ESP32-WROOM-32UE and two Python simulators that reproduce the same behavior when hardware isn’t available. The ESP32 firmware connects to Wi-Fi, reads the PMS5003 particulate sensor over UART (PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10) and the MQ131/MQ-4 gas sensors via ADC1, builds a JSON payload, and sends it by HTTP(S) POST to the server endpoint. Wi-Fi credentials, endpoint URL, and send interval are configurable, making this the code intended for field deployment on the actual board.

Because the real ESP32 isn’t always on hand for live testing, there are two companion Python programs that mimic the device. The single-device simulator generates realistic values for PMS5003, MQ131, and MQ-4, then posts them at a set interval as if they came from one ESP32 (you can tweak URL, device ID, count, and interval). The multi-device simulator does the same but for several virtual devices at once—either concurrently or in round-robin—so you can stress-test the API, storage, and dashboards with multiple nodes (e.g., IDs 001…015). Both simulators follow the same API contract as the firmware (JSON with top-level keys PMS5003, MQ131, MQ4 and Content-Type: application/json), so you can switch between simulated and real clients without changing the server. This setup lets you develop, debug, and validate the full pipeline now, and seamlessly transition to the physical ESP32 later.
